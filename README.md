# BIKESHARING...and the livings easy

## Overview:

- The purpose of this analysis is to provide statistical data on the use of shareable bikes.  This includes data on bike rental, return, gender usage, and wear and tear on the bikes. 

## Results:

- 1. (Please Refer to image "Bike Repairs (NEEDED)") This image shows squares that are assigned to individual bikes via  bike id. The darker the red (to the top left) the more in need of repair /replacement.  For example, bike #38214 is the most used with 479 uses.  This is an example of a bike in need of replacement. Strategically, you could retire teh most use bikes and push the les used out to replace them.  the new bikes bought can be put in the lesser used areas. 

- 2. (Please Refer to image "Peak Hours") This image reflects peak hours for the month of August.  If 150,000 uses of bikes is the cut off, we can see that 0800-0900 1600-2000 are peak hours.  The lowest hours are between 0100 and 0600.  Strategically speaking, major repairs should be conducted during these times and leaving emergency repair sponse for peak hours. 

- 3. (Please Refer to image "Time for Users") This image I feel is largely skewed to participants not answering their actual genders.  Outside of that it seems that a large majority of riders only use the between 0-20 minutes.  

- 4. (Please Refer to image "Times by Gender") Considering the use of gender as a means to further identify user times we can males use the bikes then females, then unknowns.  But still argely use the bikes for the same amount of times. 

- 5. (Please Refer to image "Trips by Gender (Weekly Per Hour)") This image helps in reading each genders approximate stop times. Both genders and those unknown generally stop riding around the same time (0700-0900 and 1600-1900).  This is indicitive of arrival times to work and to home.  Tells me that bikes are generally used for transportation to and from work. 

- 6. (Please Refer to image "Weekday for Each Hour") This image is a close up on the stop times for males. As previously indicated it shows a heavy use in waht seems to be hours used for getting to and from work mon-fri.  It also shows that the weekends use is heavy during mid day. This shows that he bikes are used for liesure as well as business. 

- 7. (Please Refer to image "User Trips by Gender by Weekday") This image shows me that teh majoriy of customers are male and subscribers. female subscribes are behind that and everything else is pretty even. The most popular day of use by subscribers is Thursday while Saturdays are the day of choice for non-subscribers. 

Included with his README is a link to a story I wrote on Tableau.  In this story I reflect both images for where bikes are picked up and dropped off with a small explaination.
